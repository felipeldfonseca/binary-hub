# 🧪 Authentication Testing - Step by Step

## ✅ Your Server is Running!
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001
- **Status**: ✅ Next.js server is active

## 🚀 Start Testing Now!

### Step 1: Test the Landing Page
1. Open: http://localhost:3001
2. You should see the Binary Hub landing page
3. Check that the navbar and hero section are working

### Step 2: Test Sign Up Flow
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/auth/register
2. Click the green "Sign up with email" button
3. Fill in the modal form:
   - **Name**: Felipe Test
   - **Email**: felipe@test.com
   - **Password**: password123
   - **Confirm Password**: password123
4. Click "Create Account"
5. **Expected Result**: You should be redirected to the dashboard

### Step 3: Test Sign In Flow
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/auth/login
2. Click the green "Login with email" button
3. Use the same credentials:
   - **Email**: felipe@test.com
   - **Password**: password123
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **Expected Result**: You should be redirected to the dashboard

### Step 4: Test Route Protection
1. While logged in, try to access: http://localhost:3001/auth/login
2. **Expected Result**: You should be redirected to the dashboard
3. Log out (if there's a logout button) or clear browser data
4. Try to access: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
5. **Expected Result**: You should be redirected to the login page

### Step 5: Test Form Validation
1. Go to sign up page
2. Try submitting with empty fields
3. Try an invalid email format (like "test@")
4. Try a password less than 6 characters
5. Try mismatched passwords
6. **Expected Result**: You should see validation error messages

## 🔧 If You Want to Test Google/Apple OAuth

### For Google OAuth:
1. You'll need to set up Firebase Console first
2. Go to your Firebase project → Authentication → Sign-in method
3. Enable Google provider
4. Then test the "Sign up with Google" buttons

### For Apple OAuth:
1. Requires Apple Developer account setup
2. Enable Apple provider in Firebase Console
3. Test works best on Safari/iOS

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If the site doesn't load:
- Check that http://localhost:3001 is accessible
- The server should be running (we confirmed it is)

### If authentication doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Look for any red error messages
- Firebase emulator might need to be running for full functionality

### If you get Firebase errors:
- The app is configured to use Firebase emulators
- For basic testing, email/password should work without emulators
- For full testing, run: `npm run dev` from the Binary Hub root directory

## 📱 Mobile Testing
- Test on your phone by accessing: http://192.168.0.3:3001
- Make sure you're on the same WiFi network

## 🎯 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Modal opens smoothly when clicking email buttons
- Form validation works properly
- Loading states show during authentication
- Successful redirect to dashboard after login
- Protected routes work correctly

### ❌ Red Flags:
- Modal doesn't open
- Form submissions don't work
- No loading states
- Errors in browser console
- Routes don't redirect properly

## 📞 Next Steps
Once basic email/password testing works, we can:
1. Set up Firebase emulators for full functionality
2. Configure Google/Apple OAuth
3. Test on mobile devices
4. Add more advanced features
